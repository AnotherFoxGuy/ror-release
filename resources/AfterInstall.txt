Thanks for installing Rigs of Rods!

-----------------------------------

By default, Rigs of Rods only comes with a very small selection of vehicles and terrains. 
For the best experience download some mods from the Repository: https://forum.rigsofrods.org/resources/
The Showroom Subforum (https://forum.rigsofrods.org/#repository.11) and the Archives (http://archives.rigsofrods.net/) contain additional content not found in the Repository.
If you downloaded one (or more) content packs, please note that the licenses of the included content may be different from the license used by Rigs of Rods.
